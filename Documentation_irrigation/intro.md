# Irrigation  

This document summarizes the detailed implementation of an irrigation model applied to apple orchards in Western Switzerland. Its aim is to provide arboriculturists with a tool to help them make irrigation decisions. It is based on meteorological data. 
Basically, it is an implementation of a model developed by {cite}`Pereira2007`. However, a number of details make this documentation indispensable for an overall understanding of the model's output.
